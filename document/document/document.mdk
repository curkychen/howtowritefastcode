# module 2

What are the differences between multicore and manycore processors? 

* multicore ï¼šEach core optimized for executing a single thread 
* manycore: Cores optimized for aggregate throughput, deemphasizing individual performance, 
 * Similar in scaling trends(increasing vector unit width; Increasing numbers of cores per die; increasing bandwidth to off-chip memory )
 * Different in optimization points 

What is instruction level parallelism?

* Instructions in a	 sequence that can	be	computed	at	the	same	time
* Later out of order pipline, solve the problem of traditional in order pipline(inorde r scalar pipline ) that Reduced ILP and r/w operand dependency
* AD: do not need to change the sequential software 
* DIS: 
  * Significantly	more	complex	processor	architecture	
  * Longer	to	design	the	processor
 * Longer	to	verify	the	correctness	of	the	processor	design	
  * Consumes	more	energy	than	simple	in-order	processor	

What is SIMD?

 * Single	Inst,	Multiple Data
 * Can	be	area	and	power	efficient:	AmorJze	control	overhead	over	SIMD	width	
 * Parallelism	exposed	to	programmer	&	compiler
 * NVIDIA:	32	way	SIMD
 
 How	to	UJlize	SIMD	CapabiliJes?
  * Compilers:
  Data types used for SIMD operations are called vector types. Each vector type has its corresponding scalar type
